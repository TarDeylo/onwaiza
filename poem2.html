        <h1>My Muse, My Midnight Flame</h1>
        <p>

          <br>Beneath the moon’s shy, silver gaze,
          <br>I find myself lost in your dazzling maze,
          <br>Eyes that dance like midnight stars,
          <br>Pulling me in, erasing scars.
          <br>Your laughter's a song that sets me free,
          <br>Soft as silk, wild as the sea.
          <br>With every glance, you melt the night,
          <br>A fire igniting pure delight.

          <br>The way you linger in my thoughts,
          <br>Drives me wild, and oh, I’m caught—
          <br>Each word, each smile, a sweet tease,
          <br>A spell that brings me to my knees.

          <br>You’re not just a dream or a fantasy,
          <br>You’re my electric ecstasy.
          <br>So here’s my heart—take all of me,
          <br>Because with you, love, I’m finally free.

        <h1>A Poem Of You</h1>
        <p>

            I met you once, and life began to bloom,

           <br> A quiet light that lifted every room.

            <br>You came like dawn, soft and bright,

            <br>Turning my shadows into morning light.
            
            <br>Before you, days were simple and plain,
            <br>A constant drizzle, a gentle rain.
            <br>But with your laugh, your spark, your grace,
            <br>Suddenly the world felt a warmer place.
            
            <br>Your eyes hold stories of stars and skies,
            <br>Depths that pull, like oceans rise.
            <br> I find my peace, my hope, my home,
            <br>In the way you smile, in the love you’ve shown.
            
            <br>If words could paint or dreams could show,
            <br>The beauty you brought, the love I now know,
            <br> I’d write it all, but words fall shy,
            <br> Of the wonder you are, my endless sky.</p>
